## Finding Webhook/Server URL Settings

### Method 1: Check "Tools" Tab (Current Location)

Since you're on the **Tools** tab, look for:

1. **Scroll down** in the Tools tab
2. Look for sections like:
   - **"Serverless Functions"**
   - **"Functions"**
   - **"Server Configuration"**
   - **"Custom Functions"**

3. If you see any of these, expand them and look for:
   - **"Server URL"** field
   - **"Webhook URL"** field
   - **"Endpoint"** field

### Method 2: Check "Advanced" Tab

1. Click on **"Advanced"** tab (visible in your tabs)
2. Look for sections like:
   - **"Server"**
   - **"Webhook"**
   - **"API Configuration"**
   - **"Serverless"**

### Method 3: Check "Model" Tab

Sometimes server settings are under Model configuration:
1. Click **"Model"** tab
2. Scroll down
3. Look for **"Server"** or **"Functions"** section

### Method 4: Look for "Serverless Functions" Button

1. In the **Tools** tab, look for a button or link that says:
   - **"Add Function"**
   - **"Serverless Functions"**
   - **"Custom Functions"**
   - **"Add Server"**

2. Click it - this might open a modal or section where you can configure the server URL

The fields you need might be labeled as:

## Alternative: Check Assistant Settings

If you can't find it in the tabs:

1. Look for a **gear icon** ⚙️ or **"Settings"** button (usually top right)
2. Or look for **"Edit Assistant"** button
3. This might open a different view with more settings

## Still Can't Find It?

Try this:
1. Look for a **search bar** in the dashboard
2. Search for: **"server"** or **"webhook"**
3. This might highlight where the settings are
